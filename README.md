# GameFramework
# Overview

I wanted to learn about Unreal Engine and how it can be used to create games. 

I made a simple obstacle course that is played using WASD. The goal is to get to the trophey at the end. 

My purpose in writing this code was to learn more about Unreal Engine and it's capabilities.
